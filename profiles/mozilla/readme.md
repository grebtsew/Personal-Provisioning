# HOW-TO restore bookmarks manually

There is a better way to do this and it is part of Firefox's Import function.

1. Open Firefox and open the "Firefox" menu and then the "Bookmark" menu.  When the options open to the right of "Bookmark," select "Show all Bookmarks."  Alternatively, you can hit Crtl+Shift+B.

2. Select the "Import and Backup" menu, then "Restore" and "Choose File."

3. Browse to find the file and choose "Restore."  Your bookmarks will be replaced with the bookmarks in your .json file.
