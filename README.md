# Personal-Provisioning
 Create and store personal provisioning to optimize development and reinstallations of computers.
 If you are installing new operating systems or getting new computers often for whatever reason it is a drag 
 to always reinstall all programs and fix all settings. I created this repository to speed up the process,
 it is helpful for me, and hopefully it can be helpful for more people out there. 
 Let me know if you want more functions och have any questions.

 The folder `profile` contains profiles and settings used for different programs.

 The folder `useful` contains useful files for any OS.

 # HOW-TO

 1. Login to github.com (Optional)

 2. Download repo:
 https://github.com/grebtsew/Personal-Provisioning

 3. Install for your OS, follow instructions in readme files, and take a coffee once the installations start.

 4. Done! You just saved hours of setup.

**NOTE:** If you are installing on a system with old HDD or drives, you can store this repo there while reinstalling.
